# KeyNews
The project uses the NewsAPI API to gain access to the most recent news pertaining to a particular keyword. The project can be developed and integrated with Flask/Django to create a multi-language news website. The API provides variables that can be used to create a search engine for global news sites. By using keywords, you are able to filter news quickly and easily without having to waste time searching news websites.




This idea is developed and submitted as a OneMonth assignment.
