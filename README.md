# KeyNews
This project uses NewsAPI API to gain access to the last news, related to a specific keyword. This project can be developed and integrated with Flask/Django to build a multi-languages website for breaking news. It easy to play with the variables recognized by the API to create a worldwide news website search engine. The idea behind this is to filter news using a keyword, so you don't have to lose your time searching on news websites.




This idea is developed and submitted as a OneMonth assignment.
